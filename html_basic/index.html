  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <h3>Why I Created It</h3>

  <!-- Paragraphs -->
  <p>This is my very first custom webpage. I’m learning the basics of HTML step by step, starting from the structure and moving to more advanced topics.</p>
  <p>On this page, I am practicing how to use headings, paragraphs, and images, which are the foundation of any webpage.</p>
  <p>HTML is a simple but powerful language that makes it possible to create webpages, and with CSS and JavaScript it becomes even more exciting.</p>
  <p>In the future, I’ll continue to expand this webpage with more sections, styling, and maybe even interactive features.</p>
